# pthread
> Final Project for CIS520 - multi threaded computing with **POSIX** (module pthread.h)

**pthread_main.c** will reads in the *txt* file **~wiki_dump.txt**. pthread_main parses through the file one line at a time computing the *difference of sum* for each line (*linear pairwise* comparison).

To launch the application **pthread_POSIX.sh** is the shell file to call that launches the already compiled **pthread_main**

HEADER file is **pthread_plib.h** and contains the library definitions for _main.c and the structure for **STRINGDATA**
