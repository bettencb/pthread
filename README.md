# pthread
Final Project for CIS520 - multi threaded computing with **POSIX** (pthread_)

pthread_string will call pthread_char parsing one sentence at a time and the difference of sum for each line in pthread_string

pthread_POSIX is just the shell file that call's the already compiled pthread_(*prgms).c
