# pthread
> Final Project for CIS520 - multi threaded computing with **POSIX** (pthread_)

**pthread_main.c** will read in a *txt* file and parse through the file one line at a time and computing the *difference of sum* for each line (*linear pairwise* comparison).

pthread_POSIX is just the shell file that call's the already compiled pthread_main.c
